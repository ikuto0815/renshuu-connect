# What is renshuu-connect?

Renshuu-connect is a small utility that makes it possible to take words looked up in the
Yomitan browser addon and add them to a vocabulary list on renshuu.org.

Yomichan already has an interface that is used to add cards to anki decks.
Renshuu-connect provides the same interface. This way yomichan can connect to it
without having to be modified.
